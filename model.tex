\secrel{Graph Data Model}\secdown

For first time we will use attribute graph model. Nodes represents data
elements, and edges or links shows relationships between nodes. Nodes and edges
can have properties. \neo\ also includes special case of properties\ --- labels,
you can think about label as property without value, or has value equal to
itself.

So graph structure can represent wide range of different things, look at your
whiteboard with some schemes for example. Let’s look on our prototype system
architecture at \autoref{fig:architecture}. As you can see that there is no
reason to add any extra notes: all knowledge embodied in this graph is visually
understandable. As other example, see \autoref{fig:mobile} later.

\secrel{Graph Databases}\secdown

Most graph databases uses data models, not so powerful to implement graphs shown
on figures \autoref{fig:architecture},\autoref{fig:mobile} natively. As you can
see, there is some elements not supported: grouping and containers, links on
links, N-ary relations with \mbox{$N>2$} (and custom visualization
representations). Some of this can be described in hypergraph (see
\autoref{hyper}), but for currently existing graphdb engines we need some
transformations.
