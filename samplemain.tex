\secrel{Sample program graph model}

For demo purposes letâ€™s see simple program for UNIX in pure \C{}:

\lst{src/hello.c}{hello.c}{Hello World}

\fig{fig/hello.png}{hello}{Hello World simple program
in \C{}}{width=\textwidth}

Here we see types taxonomy for primitive subset of \C{}\ language, \verb|main()|
function with arguments and \verb|return| statement. Note that function
arguments in \C\ must be ordered, so we use \emph{next} relation to add this
order. Other notable thing is double return relation of main() function: this is
sample of inherited relation\ --- \verb|(main:function)-[:return]->(int:type)|
relation was inherited from first \verb|main-[:return]->(0:int)| relation
corresponds to \verb|return 0| statement. \textbf{ako} (a-kind-of, superclass)
and \textbf{isa} (is-a) relations corresponds to inheritance and instantiation.
