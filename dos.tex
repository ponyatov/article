\secrel{Large-scale dynamic object system}\secdown

I’m impressed with SmallTalk language and interactive system see
\cite{bluebook}, but I don’t like SmallTalk syntax itself. I’m joined to
StackOverflow
\href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5732017/python-development-environments-like-smalltalk/42111909}{question}
about SmallTalk in Python, and I’m dreaming about :

\begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=*]
  \item 
system with live objects (dynamic object system) distributed over cluster 
  \item 
dedicated servers (beowulf cluster) or the best is cloud of user computers
  \item 
Pythonic control and programming language syntax able to work on 
  \item 
all modern computer platforms (PC, embedded and mobile devices) with 
  \item 
widely
used OSes (Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android) as hosted OS.
\end{itemize}

\secrel{Interpreter}

System user interface based on command line using tiny interpreter:
\url{https://github.com/ponyatov/I}

This interpreter also will be demo application for this paper showing some hints
on GDP methodology.

So I’m going to use this interpreter as Python replacement for scripting in my
\href{https://github.com/ponyatov/L}{embedded Linux} projects: Python has
problematic build process require lot of side fixes (see BuildRoot sources), so tiny clean C++ interpreter core will be
much more sufficient, especially for
\href{https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=442285.msg3390896#msg3390896}{non-Linux
hardware devices} made on modern Cortex-M microcontrollers.
