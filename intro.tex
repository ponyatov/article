\secly{Introduction}

Software development and program architecture engineering has grows complexity
in last decades. This problem is especially notable in hard real-time control
systems applied in safety-critical domains: avionics, aerospace, automobiles,
and medicine, and covered by tons of safety reglaments and standards.

If we look on some random typical software developer vacancies, we see huge
amount of conventional requirements on knowledge and skills (emphasized in
text), making developer live damn scary: to make yourself promising in your
profession, you must spend an everyday self-learning in your work and spare
time.

My previous job was linked with hardware and firmware design. So my thoughts was
about it will be great to have some \prog{Wolfram Alpha} like expert system with
lot of engineering knowledge databases (basic three sciences
Math/Physics/Chemistry, Electronics, Computer Science and Programming,
especially software synthesis using Model Driven programming, Digital Methods
and DSP), which can help me in my work.

First I dig into pure \prolog\ and read lot of books on expert systems design,
and in result it was no progress at all. In my first senses, \prolog\ is only
able to implement knowledge bases about Socrates siblings.

So in last year I faced with graph databases, especially \neo, and it looks
great for knowledge representation, and processing via graph rewrite. I feel
that graphs can be natively represented in form of \prolog\ (especially
\lang{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HiLog}{HiLog}}) clauses (edge as
predicate, and nodes as arguments), so for inference purposes it looks able to
export graph into some modern \prolog\ system like
\prog{\href{http://flora.sourceforge.net/}{Ergo/Flora}} or \xsb, do inference,
and push back results via graph rewrite requests. Or inference can be done at
graphdb engine level using some custom plugin.

My interest on hypergraph linked with \neo\ limitations of representing not more
than binary relations, so some hypothetical clause like
\\\verb|family(father,mother,sister,brother,cat)|\\ require lot of underground
work with 2-ary primitives in \neo\ data model.
