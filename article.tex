\begin{abstract}\noindent
Software development and program architecture engineering has grows complexity
in last decades. The existing zoo of programming languages, para\-digms,
hardware platforms and operating systems, combined with the software development
market requirements, exceeds the capabilities of a particular individual
developer. Thus, it is required to create a powerful tool for compensation of
software systems development complexity, that combines design tools, RAD, MDP,
simulation debugging, static and dynamic analysis of programs, parallel
computing support, and, first of all, \emph{an expert system and knowledge bases
provides knowledge storage, fuzzy search and inference} not only in software
engineering, but also in applied fields (mathematics and numerical methods,
physics, chemistry, mechanics and structural engineering, CAD, electronics,
digital signal processing, business planning, accounting and logistics, task and
time management, etc).
