\secrel{HyperGraph generalization}\label{hyper}\secdown

Lot of generic graph data model limitations tends to use more sophisticated
structure\ --- hypergraph. Hypergraph generalizes element types\ --- nodes and
links becomes unificated elements called nodes (entities or vertices), which can
define relations between any number of other nodes. So, comparing to graph,
hypergraph is free to represent links on links, and any N-ary relations between
data elements.For practical reasons it is profitable to use hypergraph entities
with properties and labels (think about it as property without value).

Grakn is power hypergraph engine specially designed for AI applications.\\
Go to \href{https://grakn.ai}{official cite} and follow its manual for system
installation\note{MacOS/Linux only}.\\
It has impressive look\&feel as the same impressive system size and computing
resources requirements: my not so old workstation crouches on server start with
empty database.
